## How Face Precepts are Influenced by Noise (Neuromatch Academy Project)
This project was completed as part of the Neuromatch Academy's Computational Neuroscience course (Summer 2024). 

**Project Goal:**

This project aimed to analyze the Miller et al. ECoG dataset to understand the role of the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) in face recognition under noisy conditions. We compared different machine learning techniques to identify the most effective method for recognizing faces based on specific thresholds within the data.

**Machine Learning Techniques Explored:**

* Logistic Regression (Implemented by teammate)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Not included in this repository)
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** (My contribution - Code included)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Implemented by teammate)
* Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Implemented by teammate)

**This repository contains the code for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.** 

**Additional Notes:**
* Due to teammate collaboration, the code for RNNs, LDA, and SVR is not included here. 

**Getting Started:**

(Include instructions on how to run the CNN code -  e.g., dependencies, environment setup, how to use the code)
